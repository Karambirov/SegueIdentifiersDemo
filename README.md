# SegueIdentifiersDemo

This is the source code for my tutorial about using Storyboad Segues protocol-oriented way, based on WWDC 2015 session called Swift in Prictice.

Back in 2015, there was a great session on WWDC called [Swift in Practice](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2015/411/). And there was an example of how to use segues protocol-oriented way. So I decided to update this example to the newest version of Swift and show it to you.

This is the source code for [my tutorial](https://medium.com/@karambirov/protocol-oriented-segues-in-ios-bea48ddbeef2).
